Legally Mandated to Document Rejection Due to Acceptance Absent Documenting Rejection Constituting Conspiracy

Eight years of rejecting this particular group, now with Gossett and Pitt making international moves with Sutherland and Austin---under my name, attempting (with decoys, mostly) to traffic my former epmloyer's federal fundecd government contractor property internationally---one of their last offers being, in additoin to a  seven hundred million dollar market  manipulation,  soft pornography of a pastor's wife. 

Ths has not been publicly communicated, generally, but it has been sent to this particular group. 

Therefore, any knowlege of this that was not communicated from direct recipients (GitHub or the emailed contact lists) is an indication of wiretapping, which may constitute a federal felony, given that this is again a continued effort, as has been the case since they sabotaged the Department of Defense Security Clearance vetting, to use me as a bridge into Govern Gavin Newsom's federal government contractor property.

Since they are going to locations of federal contractors and to other countries while attempting to traffic my information, which includes previous federal funded projects, the rejection is mandatory, because failure to refuse to comply constitutes a federal conspiracy charge.
